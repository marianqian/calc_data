Each output image has a .RAW file and .PNG file.

`num_calcs_size_cluster_v2`: Separated into `mixed/` and `small/` folders. Each image is labelled with the cluster size in voxels (5 mm = 71 vx, 10 mm = 142 vx, 20 mm = 285 vx) and the number of calcifications from 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. Ex. `prj_30mm_2_cluster_malignant_only_142_10nm_m_full_0.7_25.raw.gz.raw.png` is image for 10 mm sized cluster with 10 MIXED calcifications (`m` for mixed or `s` for small right after the number of calcifications in the image name). 

`num_calcs_size_cluster_v1` **old experiment**: There are 5 image for each size (5, 10 and 20 mm), labelled with the cluster size and 1, 2, 3, 4, or no number in the filename. In each image, there are 5 clusters with each cluster having different number of calcifications with the same cluster size.
